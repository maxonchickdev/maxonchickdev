# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push: # This will trigger the workflow on push events
    branches:
      - main # Specify the branch to listen to (e.g., main)
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/2 * * * *" # This will still run the workflow every 2 minutes

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runner's shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runner's shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
